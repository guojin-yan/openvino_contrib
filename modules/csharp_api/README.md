## üìö What is OpenVINO‚Ñ¢ C# API ?

[OpenVINO‚Ñ¢](www.openvino.ai)  is an open-source toolkit for optimizing and deploying AI inference.

- Boost deep learning performance in computer vision, automatic speech recognition, natural language processing and other common tasks
- Use models trained with popular frameworks like TensorFlow, PyTorch and more
- Reduce resource demands and efficiently deploy on a range of Intel¬Æ platforms from edge to cloud

&emsp;    This project is mainly based on OpenVINO ‚Ñ¢ OpenVINO launched by tool kit ‚Ñ¢  C # API, aimed at driving OpenVINO ‚Ñ¢   Application on the C # platform.

&emsp;    OpenVINO ‚Ñ¢  The C # API is based on OpenVINO ‚Ñ¢   C API development, supported platforms and OpenVINO ‚Ñ¢  Consistent, please refer to OpenVINO for specific information ‚Ñ¢„ÄÇ

## ‚öô How to install OpenVINO‚Ñ¢ C# API?

The following article provides installation methods for OpenVINO‚Ñ¢ C# API on different platforms, which can be installed according to your own platform.

- [Windows](docs/en/windows_install.md)

- [Linux](docs/en/linux_install.md)

## üè∑How to use OpenVINO‚Ñ¢ C# API?

- **Quick start**
  - [Deploying the Yolov8 full series model using OpenVINO‚Ñ¢ C# API](demos/yolov8/README.md)

- **Simple usage**

If you don't know how to use it, simply understand the usage method through the following code.

```c#
namespace test 
{
    internal class Program
    {
        static void Main(string[] args)
        {
            Core core = new Core();
            Model model = core.read_model("./model.xml");
            CompiledModel compiled_model = core.compiled_model(model, "AUTO"); 
            InferRequest infer_request = compiled_model.create_infer_request(); 
            Tensor input_tensor = infer_request.get_tensor("images"); 
            infer_request.infer(); 
            Tensor output_tensor = infer_request.get_tensor("output0"); 
            core.free(); 
        }
    }
}
```

The classes and objects encapsulated in the project, such as Core, Model, Tensor, etc., are implemented by calling the C API interface and have unmanaged resources. They need to be handled by calling the **dispose() ** method, otherwise memory leakage may occur.
